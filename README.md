# BDA_CEP_PART2
**Bitcoin TimeGAN Experiment:** This project implements a TimeGAN model to generate synthetic Bitcoin price data. It includes two main files - `Bitcoin_TimeGAN_Experiment.ipynb` (the code notebook) and `btcusd_1-min_data.csv` (Bitcoin price data). To run it, simply upload both files to Google Colab and run all cells. The code loads Bitcoin data, prepares it, creates 24-hour sequences, trains an LSTM neural network for 50 epochs, and generates realistic synthetic price patterns. The training takes about 5-10 minutes and produces graphs showing training progress. This is a simplified version focusing on the generator component, but it can be adapted for other time-series data. For best results, run it in Google Colab, and note that training typically takes 5-10 minutes to complete.
